title: Type inference

In these exercises you should assume the following types:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
foldr  :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
map    :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
(.)    :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
#+END_SRC

** ~foldr map~

What is the type of ~foldr map~? Give the type derivation.

    1. ~[a] -> [a -> a] -> [a]~
    2. ~[a] -> [[a -> a]] -> [a]~
    3. ~[a] -> [[a -> a] -> [a]]~
    4. ~[[a]] -> [a -> a] -> [a]~

** ~map . foldr~

What is the type of ~map . foldr~? Give the type derivation.

    1. ~(a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [[a] -> a]~
    2. ~(a -> a -> a) -> [b] -> [b -> a]~
    3. ~(b -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [[b] -> a]~
    4. ~(b -> a -> a) -> [b] -> [[a] -> a]~

** ~concat . concat~

Which of the following is the type of ~concat . concat~? Give the type derivation.


    1. ~[[a]] -> [[a]] -> [[a]]~
    2. ~[[a]] -> [[a]] -> [a]~
    3. ~[[[a]]] -> [a]~
    4. ~[a] -> [[a]] -> [a]~

Give the type derivation.

** What is the type of ~map map~?

Give the type derivation.

** ~map (map map)~

What is the type of ~map (map map)~? Give the type derivation.

    1. ~[[a -> b]] -> [[[a] -> [b]]]~
    2. ~[a -> b] -> [[[a] -> [b]]]~
    3. ~[[a -> b]] -> [[[a -> b]]]~
    4. ~[[a -> b] -> [[a] -> [b]]]~

Give the type derivation.

** ~map map map~ and brackets

Which observation is correct when comparing the types of ~(map map)
map~ and ~map (map map)?~

1. The type of the first is less polymorphic than the type of the second.
2. The type of the first is more polymorphic than the type of the second.
3. The types are the same, since function composition is associative.
4. One of the expressions does not have any type at all.
