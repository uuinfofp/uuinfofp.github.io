title: Input and Output
---


1. Extend the "guess a number" game to generate the bounds randomly.

2. Write ~sequence~ and ~sequence_~ using ~(>>=)~ instead of ~do~-notation.

3. Write a function which prompts for a filename, reads the file with this name, splits the file into a number of lines, splits each line in a number of words separated by ~' '~ (a space), and prints the total number of lines and words.

4. Given the function ~getInt :: IO Int~, which reads an integer value from standard input, write a program that results in the following input/output behaviour (the ~3~ has been typed in by the user):

     #+BEGIN_SRC
     Give a number: 3
     1 * 3 = 3
     2 * 3 = 6
     3 * 3 = 9
     ...
     10 * 3 = 30
     Goodbye
     #+END_SRC

    Try to use ~sequence_~, ~mapM_~ or ~forM_~.

5. Write a function of type ~[FilePath] −> FilePath −> IO ()~ which concatenates a list of files to a specific target file: the first parameter is a list of filenames and the second parameter the name of the target file. Do not use the function ~appendFile~.

    - Write a program that first asks for the name of the target file, and then continues asking for names of files to be appended to that file until an empty line is entered. Note that the target files may be one of the source files!

    - If we know that none of the source files equals the target file
      we may do a bit better using the function [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/System-IO.html#v:appendFile][~appendFile~ from
      ~System.IO~]]. Change the function you have written above using
      this function. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this
      approach?
