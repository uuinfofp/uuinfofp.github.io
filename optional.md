title: Optional assignment

To receive extra credit (see Description/Grading for precise grading
scheme) we encourage you to work in pairs to make a five to ten minute
video about a Haskell package or language extension. The point of the
video will be to explain the purpose of the package/extension as well
as to give examples of how to use it. The video should be able to
serve as a how-to guide for others getting started with Haskell. You
can think of the target audience as your co-students.

You can find an overview of Haskell packages on
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) and of language extensions in
the [GHC
documentation](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/index.html).

If you have a package or extension in mind that you would like to make
a video about, please contact <a href="mailto:F.Staals@uu.nl">Frank
Staals</a> or <a href="mailto:m.i.l.vakar@uu.nl">Matthijs Vákár</a>
**before the midterm on 02 October 2025** to ensure that the choice is
appropriate.  The final video should be submitted **by Fri 31 Oct
23:59**.

### Some examples

Here are a few examples of what such a video could look like.

- [List comprehensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoQsDTzBojs)
- [Using servant-client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQB2JbxNEUI)
- [A brief view at lenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fbziKgQjnw)
