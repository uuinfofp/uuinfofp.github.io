### Teaching Objectives

By the end of the course you will be able to

* solve problems using a 'functional approach'. That is, define *what*
  needs to be computed using techniques and concepts such as

    - recursion,
    - pattern matching,
    - composition,
    - higher order functions,
    - algebraic data types,
    - monads,
    - immutable and persistent data structures,
    - laziness.

* reason about the correctness and the types of functions.

* develop a small, real world game in the functional language Haskell.
