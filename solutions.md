### Lectures 1 and 2 - Functions and types

#### Exercise 1

The number of solutions is given by the result of the discriminant, `bÂ² - 4ac`.

```haskell
noOfSol a b c | discr >  0 = 2
              | discr == 0 = 1
              | otherwise  = 0
  where discr = b * b - 4 * a * c
```

#### Exercises 2 and 3

Remember that you can use `ghci` to ask for the type of an expression or its value:

```
> :t (++) [True, False]
append [True, False] :: [Bool] -> [Bool]
> [1,2] ++ [3,4]
[1,2,3,4]
```

#### Type inference

The types of `map . foldr` and `map (map map)` have been discussed in the Q&A session before the mid-term exam.


### Lecture 3 - Lists and recursion

#### Exercise 1

The evaluation of `factorial n` for any negative number loops indefinitely. The reason is that there is no base case to stop the recursion.

#### Exercise 2

```haskell
x ^ 0 = 1
x ^ n | n `rem` 2 == 0 = y * y
      | otherwise      = x * y * y
  where y = x ^ (n `div` 2)
```

#### Exercise 3

```haskell
last :: [a] -> a
last []     = error "empty list"
last [x]    = x
last (_:xs) = last xs

-- Another version which does not raise errors
last' :: [a] -> Maybe a
last' []     = Nothing
last' [x]    = Just x
last' (_:xs) = last xs
```

#### Exercise 5

In this solution I assume that the indices start at 0. E.g., `[1,2] !! 0 = 1`.

```haskell
(!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
_      !! n
    | n < 0 = error "negative index"
[]     !! _ = error "not enough elements"
(x:_)  !! 0 = x
(x:xs) !! n = xs !! (n-1)
```

#### Exercise 6

```haskell
isPalindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
isPalindrome xs = xs == reverse xs
```

#### Exercises 8, 9 and 10

```haskell
remSuccessiveDuplicates :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
remSuccessiveDuplicates []     = []
remSuccessiveDuplicates (x:xs) = x : remSuccessiveDuplicates' x xs
  where remSuccessiveDuplicates' :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [a]
        remSuccessiveDuplicates' x [] = []
        remSuccessiveDuplicates' x (y:ys)
          | x == y    =     remSuccessiveDuplicates' x ys  -- We found the same element
          | otherwise = y : remSuccessiveDuplicates' y ys  -- Start with a new value                                      
```

Exercies 9 and 10 are a variation of exercise 8, in which you need to keep extra information. Note also that:

```haskell
runLengthEncoding = map (\x -> (length x, head x)) . group
```

#### Exercise 15

```haskell
split :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]]
split n xs = split' n xs
  where split' :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
        split' _ []     = []
        split' 0 xs     = split' n xs  -- Start again
        split' n (x:xs) = let (t:ts) = split' (n-1) xs in ((x:t):ts)
                                       -- Add one to the first list

-- Using built-in functions
split _ [] = []
split n xs = take n xs : split n (drop n xs)
```

### Lecture 4 - Higher-order functions

#### Exercise 1

```haskell
applyToZero :: (Float -> Float) -> Float
applyToZero f = f 0

add :: Float -> (Float -> Float)
add x = \y -> x + y
-- or taking currying into account
add x y = x + y
-- or even reducing the arguments
add = (+)

id :: (Float -> Float) -> (Float -> Float)
id f = f  -- identity works here

apply :: (Float -> Float) -> Float -> Float
apply f n = f n  -- apply 'f' to 'n'
```

#### Exercise 2

```haskell
concat = foldr (++) []
```

#### Exercise 4

The idea here is that we will turn a list into a lists of lists. Each of these inner lists will be either empty, if we want to remove the item, or just hold a single value if we want to preserve it. If we then flatten those inner lists with `concat`, we are done.

```haskell
filter p = concat . map box
  where box x | p x       = [x]
              | otherwise = []
```

#### Exercise 5

```haskell
before :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> c
before f g = \x -> g (f x)

-- Also, before is usual composition with its arguments flipped
-- (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
before :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> c
before = flip (.)
```

#### Exercise 6

```haskell
-- The type of map for lists
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
-- We could also write it by putting [] in front
map :: (a -> b) -> [] a -> [] b
-- Now we substitute [] for (c ->)
mapFn :: (a -> b) -> (c -> a) -> (c -> b)
-- This is just function composition! ;)
```

### Lecture 5 - Data types and type classes

#### Exercise 1

```haskell
data Complex = C Float Float

instance Num Complex where
  (C a b) + (C x y) = C (a + x)    (b + y)
  (C a b) - (C x y) = C (a - x)    (b - y)
  (C a b) * (C x y) = C (a*x-b*y)  (a*y+b*x)
  negate (C a b)    = C (negate a) (negate b)
  abs    (C a b)    = C (a*a+b*b)  0
  fromInteger i     = C (fromInteger i) 0
```

#### Exercise 3

```haskell
data Set a = Set [a]

-- 'xs' is a subset of 'ys' if every element
-- of 'xs' is an element of 'ys'
subset :: Set a -> Set a -> Bool
subset (Set xs) (Set ys) = all (\x -> elem x ys) xs

instance Eq a => Eq (Set a) where
  (==) = subset
```

We need to make `Set a` its own data type because otherwise we would get two conflicting instances for `[a]`.

#### Exercise 4

```haskell
class Finite a where
  elements :: [a]

instance Finite Bool where
  elements = [False, True]

instance (Finite a, Finite b) => Finite (a, b) where
  elements = [(x, y) | x <- elements, y <- elements]

-- Auxiliary definition for Finite (Set a)
-- Computes all subsets for the given elements,
-- that is, all combinations where each element
-- in the list may or may not appear
allSubsets :: [a] -> [Set a]
allSubsets []     = [[]]
allSubsets (v:vs) = let ss = allSubsets vs
                     in ss ++ [v:s | s <- ss]

instance Finite a => Finite (Set a) where
  elements = allSubsets elements

-- Auxiliary definition for Finite (a -> b)
-- Computes all key-value pairs from two lists,
-- the first one gives the keys and the second
-- one gives the possible values
allKVPairs :: [k] -> [v] -> [[(k, v)]]
allKVPairs []     _  = [[]]
allKVPairs (k:ks) vs = [(k,v):kvs
                         | kvs <- allKVPairs ks vs
                         , v   <- vs]

instance (Finite a, Finite b, Eq a) => Finite (a -> b) where
  elements = [\k -> fromJust (lookup k kv)
               | kv <- allKVPairs elements elements]
```

### Lecture 6 - Data structures

#### Exercise 1

```haskell
findTree :: (a -> Bool) -> Tree a -> Maybe a
findTree _ Leaf = Nothing
findTree p (Node x l r)
  | p x         = Just x
  | otherwise   = findTree p l <|> findTree p r

(<|>) :: Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
Nothing <|> y = y
Just x  <|> _ = Just x
```

#### Exercise 2

```haskell
traverseTree :: (a -> [a] -> [a]) -> Tree a -> [a]
traverseTree _       Leaf         = []
traverseTree combine (Node x l r) =
  combine x (traverseTree l) (traverseTree r)

preOrderTraversal :: Tree a -> [a]
preOrderTraversal = traverseTree (\x l r -> x : (l ++ r))

inOrderTraversal :: Tree a -> [a]
inOrderTraversal = traverseTree (\x l r -> l ++ (x : r))
```

#### Exercise 7

```haskell
paths :: Tree a -> [[a]]
paths Leaf         = [[]]
paths (Node x l r) = map (x:) (paths l) ++ map (x:) (paths r)
```

### Lecture 7 - Case studies

Here is the definition of `Prop` we use in the slides:

```haskell
data Prop = Basic Bool | Var Char
          | Not Prop
          | Prop :/\: Prop | Prop :\/: Prop | Prop :=>: Prop
```

#### Exercise 1

```haskell
printProp :: Prop -> String
printProp (Basic b) = show b
printProp (Var v) = [v]
printProp (Not p)
  = "not " ++ parensPrintProp p
printProp (p1 :/\: p2) =
  = parensPrintProp p1 ++ " /\ " ++ parensPrintProp p2
printProp (p1 :\/: p2) =
  = parensPrintProp p1 ++ " \/ " ++ parensPrintProp p2
printProp (p1 :=>: p2) =
  = parensPrintProp p1 ++ " => " ++ parensPrintProp p2
  where parens s = "(" ++ s ++ ")"
        parensPrintProp p = parens (printProp p)
```

#### Exercise 2

Using the definitions in the slides, we can write it quite concisely. The only thing to change is the check *for every* assignment into a check for *at least one* assignment.

```haskell
-- Using or :: [Bool] -> Bool
satisfiable p = or [tv as p | as <- assigns (vars p)]
-- Using any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
satisfiable p = any (\as -> tv as p) (assigns (vars p))
```

If we want to refine it, we can use the function `find :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Maybe a` to return the assignment which makes the proposition true.

```haskell
satisfiable :: Prop -> Maybe (Map Char Bool)
satisfiable = find (\as -> tv as p) (assigns (vars p))
```

#### Exercise 3

Our original definition of `ArithExpr` only accounted for binary operations. But factorial is unary, so we need to expand the data type on that respect. Exponentiation is just a new binary operation, which we can put together with `Plus`, `Minus` and so on.

```haskell
data UnArithOp  = Factorial
data BinArithOp = Plus | Minus | Times | Div | Exp

data ArithExpr = Constant Integer
               | Variable Char
               | UnOp  UnArithOp  ArithExpr
               | BinOp BinArithOp ArithExpr ArithExpr

eval :: Map Char Integer -> ArithExpr -> Integer
eval _ (Constant c)  = c
eval m (Variable v)  = fromJust (lookup v m)
eval m (UnOp  o x)   = evalUnOp  o (eval m x)
  where evalUnOp Factorial = \x -> product [1 .. x]
eval m (BinOp o x y) = evalBinOp o (eval m x) (eval m y)
  where evalBinOp Plus  = (+)
        evalBinOp Minus = (-)
        evalBinOp Times = (*)
        evalBinOp Div   = div
        evalBinOp Exp   = (^^)
```
