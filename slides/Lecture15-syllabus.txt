Basic functional programming on Int, Bool, and lists of such 
Recursion 
Higher-order functions (notably, map, filter, foldr, foldl, foldl')
Algebraic data types (tuples, variants, recursion: define your own, use other people's)
Persistent data structures (understand that ADT + some constraints that are respected by API can implement common data structures;
    otherwise, not important for exam)
Type classes and instances (define your own, use other people's, ad-hoc vs parametric polymorphism)
Modules and abstract data types (undertand the basic idea of a module/abstract type, otherwise not important for exam;
    project management is not part of the exam)
Specification and testing (be able to write a specification for a programs and be able to write tests as plain predicates e.g.
    of type [a] -> Bool for a predicate on lists; be able to use Arbitrary type class and Gen monad (if we remind you of their API)
IO (IO monad, referential transparency, pure vs impure code; understand how to use the IO monad with do notation or binds;
    no need to remember specific operations in the IO monad; we would give you the operations you need, but you need to be able 
    to put them together to write a useful bit of code)
Functors and monads (notably Maybe, List monad, State monad; understand do notation and binds and be able to convert back and forth;
    be able to write some monadic piece of code, given certain operations in a monad, like get, put and modify for State)
Equational reasoning (extensional reasoning, case distinction, induction on ADTs)
Lazy evaluation (be able to say whether a function is strict or non-strict in an argument, converting to WHNF, forcing strictness through seq, infinite data structures through laziness)
Applicatives are not part of the exam! (And neither is the guest lecture)
