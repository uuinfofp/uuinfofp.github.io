-- * 4. Primitive recursion on natural numbers -- Folds
--------------------

-- We consider a type of natural numbers
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
-- We think of Zero as the number 0 and Succ n as the number n + 1.
-- On this, we can define a function
foldN :: (a -> a) -> a -> Nat -> a
foldN f e Zero     = e
foldN f e (Succ n) = f (foldN f e n)
-- analogous to foldr on [a].

data Dummy = D deriving Show


-- (a)
plus :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
plus Zero n     = n
plus (Succ m) n = Succ (plus m n)
-- or plus (Succ m) n = plus m (Succ n)



-- (b)
mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
mult n = foldN (plus n) Zero

-- (c)
listToNat :: [Dummy] -> Nat
listToNat = foldr (const Succ) Zero

-- (d)
natToList :: Nat -> [Dummy]
natToList = foldN (D:) []

-- (e)
mystery :: Nat -> Nat
-- is equivalent to the function
mystery Zero     = Zero 
mystery (Succ n) = n
-- hence, it sends "0" to "0" and "7" to "6"

-- * 5. Multiple choice
--------------------
-- a.  1. B (incorrect) -- 5 is missing
--     2. B (incorrect) -- multiple copies of every element
--     3. A (correct)
--     4. A (correct)
--     5. A (correct)
--     6. B (incorrect)  -- 1 is missing
--     7. B (incorrect) -- 5 is missing

-- c.  1. A (Well-typed)
--     2. B (Ill-typed) -- cannot apply (\x -> x +1) to []
--     3. A (Well-typed)
--     4. A (Well-typed)
--     5. B (Ill-Typed) -- g needs to have a function type, i.e. a -> b, *and* g needs to have type 'a' (otherwise you cannot apply g to it.). So we need a ~ a -> b, which cannot be the case.

-- e.  1. B (incorrect) -- initial a too many

--     2. A (correct)
--     3. A (Correct)
--     4. B (Incorrect) -- doesn't typecheck
--     5. A (Correct)
--     6. B (Incorrect) elements in the wrong order

-- * 6. Type inference
--------------------

-- (a)

-- We have that 
-- foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
-- const :: c -> d -> c 
-- id :: e -> e 
-- (Note: important to choose distinct type variables here.)

-- Observe that foldr const id should be read as (foldr const) id, as function 
-- application associates to the left.

-- Therefore, the types of const and id need to match the types of the 
-- first and second arguments of foldr, respectively.
-- That is,
-- c -> d -> c  ~  a -> b -> b  and b ~ e -> e
-- As long as those constraints are satisfied, we have that foldr const id has type [a] -> b
-- (where a and b need to satisfy the implied constraints)

-- These constraints are satisfied if and only if c ~ a, d ~ b, c ~ b and b ~ e -> e.
-- That is, iff a ~ b ~ c ~ d ~ e -> e. 
-- As [a] -> b ~ [e -> e] -> e -> e, it follows that foldr const id has type [e -> e] -> e -> e.


-- (b)

-- We have that 
-- flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
-- foldr :: (d -> e -> e) -> e -> ([d] -> e)
-- True :: Bool 
-- (&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool 
-- (Note: important to choose distinct type variables here.)

-- Recall that flip foldr True (&&) needs to be read as ((flip foldr) True) (&&),
-- as function application associates to the left.

-- flip foldr True (&&) is well-typed with type c under the constraint that 
-- the type of foldr equals that of the first argument of flip, 
-- the type of True equals that of the second argument of flip,
-- and the type of (&&) equals that of the third argument of flip.  

-- That is, under the constraint that
-- a -> b -> c ~ (d -> e -> e) -> e -> ([d] -> e)
-- b ~ Bool 
-- a ~ Bool -> Bool -> Bool.

-- or, equivalently,
-- a ~ (d -> e -> e)
-- b ~ e 
-- c ~ [d] -> e 
-- b ~ Bool 
-- a ~ Bool -> Bool -> Bool.

-- or, equivalently still,
-- a ~ Bool -> Bool -> Bool 
-- b ~ e ~ Bool
-- d ~ Bool
-- c ~ [Bool] -> Bool.

-- As c ~ [Bool] -> Bool, if follows that flip foldr True (&&) has type [Bool] -> Bool
