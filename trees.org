* Trees

1. Define a binary tree type in which leaves store values of type 'a'
   and internal nodes store values of type 'b'

2. Define a function height that given a Tree computes the height of the Tree


3. Define a function 'annotate', that given a 'Tree b Int' labels
   every internal node with the minimum and maximum value appearing
   in the leaves in its subtree.

   e.g.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   Node (Node (Leaf 3) "left" (Leaf 5))
        "root"
        (Leaf 1)

   ->

   Node (Node (Leaf 3) (3,5) (Leaf 5))
        (1,5)
        (Leaf 1)
   #+END_SRC
